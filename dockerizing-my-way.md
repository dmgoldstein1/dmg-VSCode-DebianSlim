# Dockerizing an Existing Codebase: Lessons from VSCodeServerFromDebian

## 1. **Structure and Organization**

- **Separation of Concerns:** The codebase separates Dockerfiles, build scripts, configuration files, and tests into distinct directories. This improves maintainability and clarity.
- **Version Control:** All relevant files are tracked in Git, enabling reproducibility and collaboration.

## 2. **Dockerfile and Build Script Best Practices**

- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Container build scripts should include instructions for both x86 and ARM architectures, ensuring portability across platforms.
- **Layer Minimization:** Use slim base images (e.g., Debian slim) and minimize the number of layers to reduce image size and attack surface.
- **Explicit Dependency Management:** Install only required packages and document them in configuration files (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).
- **Build Script:** Create a build script, so that even the creation of the Docker file is Infrastructure-as-Code. This build script not only passes variables to the docker build command, but performs security and usability checks, and manages logging and other functions. The dockerfile script is not intended to be used directly in the Docker CLI.
- **Localization:** The build script should attempt to query the operating system for the local time zone and time. Print the result of this query to the logs, and use this time for when log entries and file names use timestamps. Also pass this time and time zone information to the container.

## 3. **Security Practices**

- **Minimal Base Images:** Start from secure, minimal images to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **User Privileges:** Avoid running containers as root. Use non-root users where possible.
- **Minimize package dependencies:** Package dependencies increase the vulnerability surface area. If a package is simple enough that it should not need to be maintained, include its code directly in the project, rather than referencing its package repository, while citing the source to give appropriate credit. If a task is of sufficient complexity that a third-party package should be used, make a note in the build script terminal output of this vulnerability, and have the build script check to see if Docker Scout analyzed whatever version of the package is pulled. If Docker Scout did not analyze the package, always print a warning of this to the terminal output, no matter the level of verbosity. Also print a URL to the webpage of the dependency, if possible.
- **Secrets Management:** Never hardcode credentials or secrets. Use environment variables or secret management tools.
- **Proactive Auditing:** Regularly check for `.DS_Store` and other unnecessary files and secrets, removing them and updating `.gitignore`.
- **Error Handling:** Scripts and Dockerfiles should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful logs.
- **Input Parsing:** In all phases of the project, from the build script, build variables, to the code within the Docker script (if this code is available for review and not already compiled) and inputs passed to the Docker runtime and to the code inside the container, parse inputs whenever possible to avoid malicious input, code and prompt injections, or simple errors when a function can only accept a certain type of input.
- **Docker Scout:** Before the image is actually deployed, use and wait for Docker Scout to perform a full analysis. Have the build script analyze the Docker Scout output, and for each vulnerability analyzed, check to see if a patch is available. If it is available, delete the vulnerable package and add the newer, more secure package. If no patched version is available, print a message to the terminal with a URL to the CVE.

## 4. **Usability and Flexibility**

- **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration, allowing easy adaptation to different environments.
- **Configurable Builds:** Provide YAML or other config files to customize builds without modifying code.
- **Documentation:** Include clear README files and comments to guide users and developers.

## 5. **Debuggability**

- **Verbose Logging:** Enable verbose logging in the terminal when the build script is run in debug mode. Verbose logging should always be saved to logs in a dedicated `LOGS` directory with timestamped filenames. Verbose logging to the terminal can also be enabled independently during a standard run of the build script.
- **Testing:** Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Ensure tests cover new and existing functionality.
- **Automated Test Execution:** Provide scripts to run tests automatically after builds. These tests should be performed on every build, not just when the script is run in debug mode.

## 6. **Maintainability**

- **Consistent Naming and Indentation:** Use meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.
- **Refactoring:** When refactoring, ensure code is more efficient and readable, without introducing new bugs.
- **Commit Hygiene:** Use descriptive commit messages and reference related issues or features.- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Ensure that changes are tested and deployed automatically using a CI/CD pipeline for reliability and faster iteration.
